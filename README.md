# My pokémon list

This is a mid-term evaluation exercise for the third sprint in [Adalab](https://adalab.es/). The main goal of this exercise was to self-assess my knowledge and skills in basic React after one week learning to use this framework. I received my teacher's feedback on my work and had the chance to improve the exercise.

It's a simple webpage showing a list of Pokémon.

I'm still learning so please, if you spot a bug, want to improve my code or just show me another way to do things, don't hesitate to open an issue or send a PR!

## How to use this repo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In order to make it work, first you need to have a package manager installed, such as npm in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). Then you'll need to install `create-react-app` globally:

`$ npm install -g create-react-app`

or

`$ yarn install -g create-react-app`

Now you can:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies by running `$ npm install` / `$ yarn install`.
3. In the project directory, type `$ npm start` / `$ yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
5. Start coding! :)
